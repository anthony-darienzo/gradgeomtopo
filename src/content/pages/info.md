  description: Learn more about the UIUC Graduate Geometry-Topology seminar.
---
For Fall 2024, we are meeting on *Mondays* from 1:00PM to 1:50PM. In
**Lincoln Hall 1027.**

We are a graduate-student run seminar showcasing special topics in
geometry and topology at large. Talks in this seminar often involve
Differentiable/Riemannian geometry, analysis on manifolds, and metric
spaces. There have also been talks in topological data analysis and
sheaf theory.

Graduate students at all levels are welcome to participate. The
graduate student seminars are opportunities to practice talks before a
conference, or to present something interesting to share among
friends. After all, the best way to learn something is to teach it!

We have a mailing list,
[*gradgeomtopo@lists.illinois.edu*](https://lists.illinois.edu/lists/info/gradgeomtopo).

Abstracts of past talks can be found [here](/talks).

Questions? Feel free to ask the organizer, Anthony D'Arienzo ([apd6 AT
illinois DOT edu](https://adarienzo.web.illinois.edu)).
