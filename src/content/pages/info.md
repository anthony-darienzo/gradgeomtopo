  description: Learn more about the UIUC Graduate Geometry-Topology seminar.
---

We are a graduate-student run seminar showcasing special topics in
geometry and topology at large. Talks in this seminar often involve
Differentiable/Riemannian geometry, analysis on manifolds, and metric
spaces. There have also been talks in topological data analysis and
sheaf theory.

Graduate students at all levels are welcome to participate. The
graduate student seminars are opportunities to practice talks before a
conference, or to present something interesting to share among
friends. After all, the best way to learn something is to teach it!

We are currently planning the Fall 2024 seminar. The date and time
will be released in the next couple of weeks. [*Click here to propose

We have a mailing list,
[*gradgeomtopo@lists.illinois.edu*](https://lists.illinois.edu/lists/info/gradgeomtopo).

Abstracts of past talks can be found [here](/talks).

Questions? Feel free to ask the organizer, Anthony D'Arienzo ([apd6 AT illinois DOT edu](https://adarienzo.web.illinois.edu)).
