title: Lie's Third Theorem for Lie Infinity-Algebras
author: Connor Grady
excerpt: Just over a week ago, a huge extension to Lie's third theorem was published on arXiv by Chris Rogers and Jesse Wolfson. This theorem extends its classical counterpart to the realm of higher groups and higher algebras. In this talk, I'll be discussing some background, context, and key players in the story so that an interested listener/reader can more safely jump into the deep end of the proof themselves.

Just over a week ago, a huge extension to Lie's third theorem was
published on arXiv by Chris Rogers and Jesse Wolfson. This theorem
extends its classical counterpart to the realm of higher groups and
higher algebras. In this talk, I'll be discussing some background,
context, and key players in the story so that an interested
listener/reader can more safely jump into the deep end of the proof
themselves.
