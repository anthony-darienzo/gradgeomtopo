title: Combinatorial Approaches for Computing Knot Floer Homology
author: Cai Zeng
excerpt: Knot (or link) Floer homology is a homology theory defined for pairs (Y,K), where Y is a closed 3-manifold and K is a knot (or link) within it. Developed at the beginning of this century, knot Floer homology has proven to be a powerful tool for studying knots, links, and various related areas in low-dimensional topology. However, explicitly computing knot Floer homology for arbitrary pairs from its definition can be extremely hard. Around 2010, a series of works explored combinatorial approaches to computation. In this talk, I will introduce the approach that uses "nice diagram", offering a canonical algorithm applicable to any pair (Y,K). I will discuss in detail the case of Y=S^3, known as the "grid diagram" method, as well as the more complex case of Y = S^2 \times S^1.

A basic understanding of topology and geometry is required. Familiarity with Heegaard splitting and Morse theory would be beneficial but is not essential.
