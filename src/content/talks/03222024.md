title: Asymptotic Dimension of Various Spaces
author: Manisha Garg
excerpt: The asymptotic dimension of a metric space is a large-scale analog of topological dimension. It was introduced by Gromov in the context of geometric group theory as a quasi-isometry invariant of finitely generated groups. In this talk, we will introduce the asymptotic dimension by emphasizing on the large-scale nature of dimension and working on various examples. In particular, we will present Roe’s proof that the asymptotic dimension of Gromov-hyperbolic spaces is finite, which proves that the Novikov conjecture for these spaces is true. If time permits, we will also examine the asymptotic dimension for some groups such as free groups and one-relator groups.
