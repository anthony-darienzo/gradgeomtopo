title: PDEs, Symmetries, and Invariants
author: Wilmer Smilde
excerpt: Symmetries of PDEs often arise as (Lie) Pseudogroups. Their invariants—objects preserved by the symmetries—play an essential role in determining when two solutions of a PDE are equivalent and in determining the right space of solutions to a geometric problem, or even in the construction of solutions.

Symmetries of PDEs often arise as (Lie) Pseudogroups. Their invariants—objects preserved by the symmetries—play an essential role in determining when two solutions of a PDE are equivalent and in determining the right space of solutions to a geometric problem, or even in the construction of solutions.

In this talk, I will highlight some aspects of the theory of Lie pseudogroups. I will introduce the formalism of PDEs and Lie pseudogroups, explain what invariants are and why they are relevant, and give some examples of PDEs with symmetry and their invariants. I will also present the Lie-Tresse theorem, which states that, under mild regularity assumptions, the space of invariant functions is generated by finitely many invariants and invariant derivatives.
