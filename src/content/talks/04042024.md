title: The Virtually Haken Conjecture
author: Brevan Ellefsen
excerpt: After having introduced the elementary theory of Haken manifolds, we now dive into their modern theory. (A brief review will be given forthose who did not attend the first talk). This talk will focus on the history and ideas developed by Wise, Agol, and others toward the proof of the Virtually Haken Conjecture. We will also consider group theoretic applications and investigations, and will briefly discuss open and future problems as time allows.
