title: A Moser Technique for Degenerate Symplectic Forms
author: Anthony D'Arienzo
excerpt: Moser's argument describes the local rigidity of symplectic forms by providing an isotopy from a neighborhood of a symplectic manifold to a fixed local picture. On the other hand, symplectic structures are hard to come by, pointing the way to searching for degenerate symplectic structures with prescribed degeneracies along submanifolds. I will present a Moser-type argument by Ko Honda for degenerate harmonic 2-forms. In four dimensions, these have a nice picture, providing hope for a local theory.

Moser's argument describes the local rigidity of symplectic forms by
providing an isotopy from a neighborhood of a symplectic manifold to a
fixed local picture. On the other hand, symplectic structures are hard
to come by, pointing the way to searching for degenerate symplectic
structures with prescribed degeneracies along submanifolds. I will
present a Moser-type argument by Ko Honda for degenerate harmonic
2-forms. In four dimensions, these have a nice picture, providing hope
for a local theory.

This talk is based on the paper *Local Properties of Self-Dual Harmonic 2-Forms on a 4-Manifold*, by Ko Honda, found [here](https://www.math.ucla.edu/~honda/moser.pdf) ([DOI:10.1515/crll.2004.2004.577.105](https://doi.org/10.1515/crll.2004.2004.577.105)).
