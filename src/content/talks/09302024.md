A big problem in index theory is to establish index formulas for
families of Dirac operators, which amounts to finding a suitable
representative for the Chern character of the K-theoretic "index
bundle" of the family.

I'll introduce the index bundle and explain Quillen's approach to this
problem using superconnections, where the index formula is deduced
from a transgression formula appearing in Chern-Weil theory.
