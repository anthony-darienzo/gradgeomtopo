title: Bochner Technique and Applications
author: Huy Tran
excerpt: In Riemannian Geometry, a central concern lies in understanding the relationship between curvature and the topology of Riemannian manifolds. This is motivated by Hogde’s theorem, which asserts that every de Rham cohomology class is represented by a harmonic form. Bochner established a crucial link to geometry by showing that the first Betti number of compact manifolds with positive Ricci curvature must vanish. Berger and Meyer further contributed by establishing vanishing results for the Betti numbers of manifolds with positive curvature operators. Tachibana, utilizing Bochner’s technique, proved a rigidity result for Einstein manifolds with positive curvature operators. Recently, Petersen and Wink have extended the results of Meyer, Berger, and Tachibana by introducing more generalized curvature conditions. In this talk, I aim to provide the framework for Bochner’s technique, followed by Petersen and Wink’s new method of controlling curvature terms. Finally, I will discuss several applications of Bochner’s technique.
